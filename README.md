# Getting Started with OMDbApi React App

To start this project simply download and npm start

## Why there is no github pages

Due to my lack of knowledge of github pages (it was my first time) , i deployed it, and after that i realised fetching does not work becouse of http istead of https requested.
Then i tried to commit it but by mistake i delete it and github does not allow me to get it back, so due to lack of time (2hours left) i have to give you what i made.
